# VC(Virtual Coin)

## ⚠️ Note
🚧 Work In Progress: Optimizing performance and refactoring codebase.

This project is hosted on a free-tier server. 
Please note that the initial loading may take 1~2 minutes as the server wakes up from inactivity.
Thank you for your patience

## 👀 let's going to coin world!
<a href="https://virtualcoinn.onrender.com/" target="_blank">VirtualCoin</a>

# 👤 Persona
- to help beginners experience and learn about coin world.
- 코인을 처음 접하는 사람들에게 친숙하고 직관적인 경험을 제공하고 싶어서 이 프로젝트를 시작했습니다.
- the combinations of development and my ambitious about coin made this project more enjoyable and meaningful.
- 개발을 하며 직접 코인에 대해 공부하고자 하는 의지에서 비롯되었습니다.하고 싶은 주제를 다루면 더욱 동기부여가 되고, 자연스럽게 몰입할 수 있었기 때문입니다.

## 📁 폴더 구조(Folder Structure)
- organized by components to improve Reusability and maintainbility.
- 컴포넌트 단위로 폴더를 구조화하여 재사용성과 유지보수성을 높였습니다.

## 🔄 실시간 데이터 처리 - WebSocket
- real-time data is essential due to the constantly changing of coin price
  - 실시간으로 시세가 변동되므로, WebSocket을 통해 실시간 가격 수신이 필요했습니다
- useing REST API too frequently cause `429 Too Many Requests` errors(upbit limits requests to 10 pre second)
  - 업비트의 REST API는 1초에 10회 이상 요청 시 429(Too Many Requests) 에러가 발생합니다
- `CORS` issues prevent direct requests from the browser
  - 브라우저에서 직접 요청 시 CORS 에러로 인해 데이터 접근이 차단됩니다
- websocket solve these problems by allowing the server to push data directly
  - WebSocket은 서버에서 데이터를 직접 Push해주므로, 성능과 안정성 면에서 효율적이었습니다.

## ⚙️Optimization
- `useCallback, useMemo` to prevent unnecessary reRender of function and values -> improved component rendering speed
- soft Delete : hides data on the client instead of actual deleting it. -> maintains data integrity, especially for related datasets
- proxy server for upbit api
  - upbit doesn't allow `CORS` so direct access fail
  - created a proxy server to fetch upbit data and forward it to browser

--- 
## 🔫troubleshooting
- i was going to use binance api but i found it too many coins.
  - so i switched to upbit api for beginner
- UI was poor and confusing at the first time.
  - redesigned to enhance clarify and usability

## ✏️what i learned
- by implementing `websocket`, i got understanding of how to handle websocket
- i resolved CORS issues using a proxy server which helped me understand browser and server security policies
- i became comfortable using `userCallback`, `useMemo`, `recoil` while optimizing state management and improving performance
- i improved my understanding of `React Query`
- i realized the importance of UI/UX again and learned the necessity of contiuous refactoring and design improvement to enhance user experience
